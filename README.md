# Pixel Bites : OdinProject Restaurant Page Project

**Note:** The website is not mobile responsive. This may be an improvement done in the future, however it is not certain.

This website was made for the OdinProject's Restaurant Page assignment. The assignment's purpose was to make a multi page Restaurant website using WebPack to bundle files.

## Live Demo:

## About Website:
The idea I settled on is a retro arcade and pixel themed cafe called Pixel Bites. Every desgin choice is based on this theme. The menu items are also named after classic arcade games. My favorite thing is the background which is a cozy campire gif from the game Shovel Knight which works really well with the theme and colors for the website.

## Made Using:
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Node.js
- Webpack and Other Node.js Modules
